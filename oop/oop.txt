/*
A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of class.
A constructor allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.
A destructor is called when the object is destructed or the script is stopped or exited.
Access Modifiers
    _public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default
    _protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class
    _private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class
Inheritance in OOP:When a class derives from another class.
The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class.
Constants cannot be changed once it is declared.
Class constants can be useful if you need to define some constant data within a class.
Abstract classes and methods are when the parent class has a named method, but need its child class(es) to fill out the tasks.
An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method. 
An abstract method is a method that is declared, but not implemented in the code.
